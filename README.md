# Linear to GitHub Sync

This is a system to synchronize Linear issues to GitHub issues when a specific tag is added to the Linear issue. This allows contributors to work with open source projects without having to give them access to your internal Linear team.

# Setup

Simply one-click deploy on Railway (or clone and deploy on Heroku, DigitalOcean, etc.).

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/new/template/L__0PR)

See [Setup.md](Setup.md) for dev instructions. If you need any help, please feel free to raise an [issue](https://github.com/calcom/linear-to-github/issues/new)!
